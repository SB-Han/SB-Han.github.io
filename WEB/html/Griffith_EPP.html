      Please observe the distinction here between a type of mechanics and a particular force law
	The force law tells you what F is, in the case at hand; the mechanics tells you how to use F to determine the motion.</li><br>

<li>P. 17<br>
We may picture the interaction as consisting of a stream of photons passing back and forth between the two charges, each electron continually emitting photons and continually absorbing them.</li><br>

<li>p. 18<br>
The point is that in a bound state enormous numbers of photons are continually streaming back and forth, so that the ‘lumpiness’ of the field is effectively smoothed out, and classical electrodynamics is a suitable approximation to the truth.</li><br>

<li>P. 21<br>
The absence of the ‘expected’ electron in the sea would be interpreted as a net positive charge in that location, and the absence of its expected negative energy would be seen as a net positive energy. Thus a ‘hole in the sea’ would function as an ordinary particle with positive energy and positive charge.</li><br>

<li>P. 48<br>
Unlike the strange particles or the psi, however, (but like the top quark a decade later) the intermediate vector bosons were long awaited and universally expected, so the general reaction was a sigh of relief, not shock or surprise.</li><br>

<li>P. 64<br>
It follows that the primitive QED vertex by itself does not represent a possible physical process. We can draw the diagram., but calculation would assign to it the number zero. The reason is purely kinematical: e -> e + photon would violate conservation of energy. (In the CM frame the electron is initially at rest, so its energy is mc^2. It cannot decay into a photon plus a recoiling electron because the latter alone would require an energy greater than mc^2.) Nor, for instance, is electron + positron -> photon kinematically possible, although it is easy enough to draw the diagram </li><br>

<li>P. 65<br>
If a photon is emitted on Alpha Centauri,, and absorbed in your eye, it is technically a virtual photon, I suppose. However, in general, the farther a virtual particle is from its mass shell the shorter it lives, so a photon from a distant star would have to be extremely close to its ‘correct’ mass - it would have to be almost ‘real’. As a calculation matter, you would get essentially the same answer if you treated the process as two separate events ( emission of a real photon by star, followed by absorption of a real photon by eye). You might say that a real particle is a virtual particle that lasts long enough that we don’t care to inquire how it was produced, or how it is eventually absorbed.</li><br>

<li>P. 73<br>
Notice that any process mediated by the photon could also be mediated by the Z</li><br>

<li>P. 83<br>
The OZI rule is related to asymptotic freedom in the following sense: in an OZI-suppressed diagram the gluons put be ‘hard’ (high energy), since they carry the energy necessary to make the hadrons into which they fragment. But asymptotic freedom says that gluons couple weakly at high energies (short ranges). By contrast in OZI-allowed processes the gluons are typically ‘soft’ (low energy), and in this regime the coupling is strong. </li><br>

<li>P. 100<br>
By its nature, a collision is something that happens so fast that no external force, such as gravity, or friction with the track, has an appreciable influence.</li><br>

<li>P. 102<br>
The answer is that all ‘internal’ forms of energy are reflected in the rest energy of an object.

Nevertheless, in principle, whenever you weigh an object, you are measuring not only the rest energies(masses) of its constituent parts, but all of their kinetic and interaction energies as well.</li><br>

<li>P. 108<br>
This example illustrates the inefficiency of scattering off a stationary target; conservation of momentum forces you to waste a lot of energy as kinetic energy in the final state.</li><br>

<li>P. 109<br>
Now, a factor of 4 is some benefit, to be sure, but the relativistic gain can be greater by far. Colliding electrons with a laboratory kinetic energy of 1 GeV, for example, would have a relative kinetic energy of 4000GeV!</li><br>

<li>P. 116<br>
In some respects, the appeal to symmetry is characteristic of an incomplete theory.

Why bother with partial information when we can have it all? But even in a mature theory, symmetry consideration often lead to deeper understanding and calculational simplification</li><br>

<li>P. 116<br>
Newton recognized that fundamental symmetries are revealed not in the motions of individual objects, but in the set of all possible motions - symmetries are manifest in the equation of motion rather than a solutions to those equations.</li><br>

<li>P. 119<br>
An ordinary scalar belongs to the one-dimensional representation of the rotation group, SO3, and a vector belongs to the three-dimensional representation; four-vectors belong to the four-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group; and the curious geometrical arrangement of Gell-Mann’s Eightfold Way corresponds to irreducible representations of the group SU3</li><br>

<li>P. 129<br>
This is still just notation; the physics comes in Heisenberg’s proposition that the strong interactions are invariant under rotations in isospin space.</li><br>

<li>P. 139<br>
In a theory with parity invariance, you must never add a vector to a pseudo vector.</li><br>

<li>P. 140<br>
As we shall see, it is precisely the addition of a vector to a pseudo vector in the theory of weak interactions that leads to the breakdown of parity.</li><br>

<li>P. 147<br>
The neutral kaon system adds a subtle twist to the old question, ‘What is a particle?’ Kaons are typically produced by the strong interactions, in eigenstates of strangeness(K0 and K0bar), but they decay by the weak interactions, as eigenstates of CP(K1 and K2).</li><br>

<li>P. 147<br>
If at this point, we observe a 2pi decay, we shall know that CP has been violated.</li><br>

<li>P. 148<br>
Although 32% of all K_L’s decay by the 3pi mode we have discussed, 41% go to
(A) pi+ + electron + anti electron neutrino
(B) pi- + positron + electron neutrino

Notice that CP takes (a) into (b), so if CP were conserved, and K_L were a pure eigenstate (a) and (b) would be equally probable. But experiments show that K_L decays more often into a positron than into an electron, by a fractional amount 3.3*10^-3. Here, for the first time, is a process that makes an absolute distinction between matter and antimatter, and provides an unambiguous, convention-free definition of positive charge; it is the charge carried by the lepton preferentially produced in the decay of the long-lived neutral K meson.</li><br>

<li>P. 149<br>
Thus the initial conditions may give us a clue to the ‘arrow of time’, but the laws governing the collisions themselves work just as well forward as backward.</li><br>

<li>P. 165<br>
The fine structure constant, alpha, owes its name to the fact that it (or rather, alpha squared) sets the relative scale of the fine structure in hydrogen. However, one might equally well say that alpha squared sets the scale of the Bohr levels themselves.
Actually, the best way to characterize the fine structure constant is to say that it is the dimensionless measure (in units of h bar c) of the (square of the) fundamental charge : alpha = e squared / h bar c</li><br>

<li>P. 169<br>
In the case of hydrogen, the reduced mass differs from the electron mass by only a very small amount, about 0.05%. Nevertheless, technically the m in the Bohr formula is the reduced mass, and this leads to observable differences between the spectra of hydrogen and deuterium.</li><br>

<li>P. 197<br>
We have three experimental probes of elementary particle interactions: bound states, decays, and scattering.</li><br>

<li>P. 203<br>
The amplitude contains all the dynamical information; we calculate it by evaluating the relevant Feynman diagrams, using the Feynman rules appropriate to the interaction in question. The phase space factor is purely kinematic; it depends on the masses, energies, and momenta of the participants, and reflects the fact that a given process is more likely to occur the more ‘room to maneuver’ there is the final state.</li><br>

<li>P. 204<br>
In essence, Fermi’s Golden Rule says that a transition rate is given by the product of the phase space and the (absolute) square of the amplitude.</li><br>

<li>P. 208<br>
Mathematically, there were just enough delta functions to cover all the variables; physically, two-body decays are kinematically determined:</li><br>

<li>P. 220<br>
In case it is some comfort, essentially the same thing occurs in classical electrodynamics: the electrostatic energy of a point charge is infinite, and makes an infinite contribution to the particle’s mass.</li><br>

<li>P. 315<br>
This number should come as something of a shock : it is larger than the electromagnetic fine structure constant, by a factor of nearly 5! Weak interactions are feeble not because the intrinsic coupling is small (it isn’t), but because the mediators are so massive - or, more precisely, because we typically work at energies so far below the W mass that the denominator in the propagator is extremely large.</li><br>

<li>P. 322<br>
Notice that we introduce the (weak) pion form factor at the level of M, whereas for the (electromagnetic) proton form factors we waited until the M2 stage. The reason is that the proton has a spin, and we would have to include that in the roster of available vectors; it is only after we have averaged over the spins that the list reduces to two, and the problem becomes manageable. The pion, however, has no spin, so we can afford to introduce the form factor directly in M, where it is only a vector quantity, instead of a tensor.</li><br>

<li>P. 323<br>
At first glance, this is a very surprising result, for it predicts (correctly) that the pion prefers the muon mode, in spite of the fact that the electron is much lighter. Phase space considerations favor decays for which the mass decrease is as large as possible, and unless some conservation law intervenes, we ordinarily find that the lightest final state is the most common one. Pion decay is the notorious exception, and it calls for some special dynamical explanation. A clue is suggested by equation 9.76: notice that if the electron were massless, the pi -) electron + anti electron neutrino mode would be forbidden altogether.</li><br>

<li>P.327<br>
The Cabibbo-GIM scheme invites a simple and beautiful interpretation: instead of the physical quarks d and s, the ‘correct’ states to use in the weak interactions are d’ and s’.</li><br>


<li>P. 331<br>
Their cross sections were about a third as large as those of the related charged events, indicating that this was indeed a new kind of weak interaction, and not simply the higher-order process,(which would yield a far smaller cross section).</li><br>

<li>P. 334<br>
You might well ask why it took so long for neutral weak interactions to be detected in the laboratory; after all, 15 years separate Buldman’s original speculations from the definitive experiments at CERN. The reason is that most neutral processes are ‘masked’ by competing electromagnetic ones.

중략

That’s why neutrino scattering was originally used to confirm the existence of neutral weak interactions; neutrinos have no electromagnetic coupling, so the weak effects are not obscured.</li><br>

<li>P. 336<br>
The problem is that we have treated the Z boson as a stable particle, which it is not. It’s lifetime is finite, and this has the effect of ‘smearing out’ its mass. We can account for this by modifying the propagator.</li><br>


<li>P. 339<br>
I’m only warning you that the name is misleading: ‘left-handed’ does not mean ‘helicity -1’, except in contexts where the particle’s mass is negligible.</li><br>

<li>P. 342<br>
So attractive is this formulation that physicists have come to regard left- and right- handed fermions almost as different particles. In this view, the factor (1- gamma 5)/2 in the charged weak vertex characterizes the participating particles, rather than the interaction itself; the latter is vectorial in all cases - strong, electromagnetic, and weak alike.</li><br>

<li>P. 342<br>
There is a danger in carrying this too far. You may find yourself wondering, for example, whether the left-handed electron necessarily has the same mass as the right-handed electron; or, noting that no vector interaction can couple a left-handed particle to a right-handed one, you may ask how the two ‘worlds’ communicate at all. Both questions are based on a misunderstanding of uL and uR. The problem is that, useful as it is in describing particle interactions, handedness is not conserved in the propagation of a free particle(unless its mass is zero). Formally, gamma5 does not commute with the free-particle Hamiltonian. In fact, u_l and u_R do not satisfy the Dirac equation. A particle that starts out left-handed will soon evolve a right-handed component. (By contrast helicity is conserved in free-particle propagation.) Only for massless fermions can left- and right- handed species be considered distinct particles in the full sense of the world.</li><br>

<li>P.356<br>
Since psi is a complex spinor, there are actually eight independent fields here( i runs from 1 to 8): the real and imaginary parts of each of the four components of psi. But in applying the Euler-Lagrange equations any linear combinations of these eight will do just as well, and we choose to use the four components of psi plus the four components of psi-bar.</li><br>

<li>P. 373<br>
But wait! The sign is wring - if that’s a mass term, then m is imaginary, which is nonsense. How, then, should we interpret this Lagrangian? To answer this question, we must understand that the Feynman calculus is really a perturbation procedure, in which we start from the ground state (the ‘vacuum’) and treat the fields as fluctuations about that state. </li><br>

<li>P. 374<br>
I emphasize that these Lagrangians (Equations 10.108 and 10.113) represent exactly the same physical system; all we have done is to change the notation(Equation 10.112). But the first version is not suited to the Feynman calculus (technically, a perturbation series in phi would not converge, because it is an expansion about an unstable point) </li><br>

<li>P.380<br>
Please understand: The Lagrangians in Equations 10.129 and 10.136 describe exactly the same physical system; all we have done is to select a convenient gauge and rewrite the fields in terms of fluctuations about a particular ground state. We have sacrificed manifest symmetry in favor of notation that makes the physical content more transparent, and allows us to extract the Feynman rules more directly.</li><br>
